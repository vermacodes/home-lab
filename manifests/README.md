# Manifests

This is a collection of all the softwares I deployed in my home lab. Not with exact same secrets though 🙂.

## Why Manifests and not Helm Charts?

I am choosing to use plain old manifests and not something like Helm cause it simple and good enough for my setup. Though Helm Charts are amazing, they really show huge advantages when we are distributing the software and/or deploying it in multiple environments with different configurations.
